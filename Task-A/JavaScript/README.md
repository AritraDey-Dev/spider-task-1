# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game application implemented in JavaScript. The game follows the standard rules where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game detects win conditions and declares a winner or indicates a draw if no winner is found.

## Features

### Basic Features
- Two-player mode: Players take turns to mark X or O on the grid.
- Win detection: The game detects when a player has won.
- Draw detection: The game indicates a draw if no winner is found.

### Brownie Points
- Dynamic Grid: The grid can expand to 4x4 or 5x5 during the game, adding complexity and new strategies.
- Timed Moves: Each player has a limited amount of time to make their move, adding pressure and excitement.
